## Checklist

- [ ] Formatting reminder: Ensure 2 spaces after each line for line breaks  
- [ ] Run the code periodically with `System.out.println` to check return values and ensure it compiles  
- [ ] Best practice: time-split 45/15-minute for go over coding/time-efficiency - i.e. sorting is less time efficient than iterate through whole dataset
- [ ] Ask what are the constraints 
- [ ] Think of clarifying questions 
- [ ] Any edge cases?
